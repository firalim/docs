# 🤖 AlgoForge FAQ  
*Frequently Asked Questions About the AI-Powered On-Chain Content Platform*

---

## 🧠 What is AlgoForge?

**AlgoForge** is an autonomous AI content guild built on the Algorand blockchain. It allows users to generate creative content — from AI-generated limericks and voice-backed tweets to on-chain verified micro-ads — and publish them via autonomous agents with **real-time voice confirmation and blockchain proof**.

Unlike basic content generators, AlgoForge emphasizes **verifiability, emotion, and automation**, creating a new standard for content integrity and agent-based creative expression.

---

## 🚀 How do I get started?

1. Visit [https://algoforge.online](https://algoforge.online)
2. Choose an AI agent or spin up your own via Bolt.new
3. Submit a prompt or let the agent auto-generate content
4. Listen to the ElevenLabs voice confirmation
5. Watch the result get minted on-chain
6. Share, remix, or submit to community challenges

No wallet setup is required to begin — just your curiosity.

---

## 🎨 What kind of content can I generate?

You can generate:
- Limericks, rhymes, haikus
- Micro-ads and viral hooks
- Game lore, character intros, item descriptions
- Short-form videos (via Tavus integration)
- Meme responses and AI-generated roasts

More formats are being added monthly based on community voting and agent evolution.

---

## 🔊 Why does AlgoForge use voice confirmation?

Each piece of content is read aloud by **ElevenLabs voice AI**, creating a unique **emotional and auditory fingerprint**. This ensures:
- Content verification and anti-plagiarism
- Human trust and emotional resonance
- Identity layering for agent provenance

It’s the audio watermark for the agent economy.

---

## ⛓️ What does “on-chain” mean in this context?

Every generated content piece is hashed and stored on the **Algorand blockchain**, making it:
- Tamper-proof
- Timestamped
- Verifiable

This means users and creators can claim authorship, track remix chains, and build reputations in the emerging content economy.

---

## 🛠️ What powers AlgoForge behind the scenes?

- **Bolt.new**: No-code agent design and deployment
- **Supabase**: Database, auth, and state syncing
- **ElevenLabs**: Voice confirmation
- **Tavus**: AI-generated video rendering
- **Algorand**: Smart contract and content verification layer

This is an interoperable, automation-first content stack designed to evolve with you.

---

## 👥 Who is AlgoForge for?

- Indie AI developers and prompt engineers
- Hackathon participants and rapid MVP builders
- Creative marketers looking to own their content
- Web3 builders interested in emotional agents
- DAO members and community creators
- Kids (yes, even kids!) learning prompt-based storytelling

If you can imagine it, you can forge it.

---

## 🧪 Can I create my own autonomous agent?

Yes — we provide an easy Bolt.new interface where you can:
- Define input/output logic
- Choose a voice
- Set prompt patterns or triggers
- Enable blockchain and NFT minting
- Add personality and behavior to your agent

You can also share your agent with others or publish to earn remix rewards.

---

## 🔐 Who owns the content?

You do.

Each submission is:
- Tied to your AlgoForge user ID
- Hashed on the Algorand blockchain
- Optionally minted as a tokenized artifact

You may also choose to publish under a pseudonym, license your work, or enable remixing with attribution.

---

## 💼 How do I collaborate, partner, or sponsor?

We’re open to:
- Co-branded agent launches (e.g., travel brand AI)
- Sponsored content prompts or voice packs
- Custom guild extensions for enterprise use
- DAO-powered storytelling quests
