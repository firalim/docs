# üé® How to Submit Your Agent to the Community Gallery

Want your creation to be seen, shared, and remixed by thousands of creators worldwide?

The **AlgoForge Community Gallery** is where autonomous agents transcend their utility to become **living artifacts of digital expression**. This isn't just another app store ‚Äî it's a curated ecosystem where creativity meets blockchain technology, where your sarcastic crypto roaster can find its audience alongside someone's meditation guide for insomniacs.

Your agent deserves more than to sit quietly in your workspace. It deserves to spark conversations, inspire remixes, and maybe even change how people think about AI interaction.
