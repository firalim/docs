# 🧪 Build Your First Agent

Welcome to the **Hello World** of AlgoForge.

This is where the magic begins — **you create your very first AI-powered autonomous content agent**.

Whether you're building a **limerick bot**, a **crypto-themed roaster**, or a **travel guru with a British accent**, this guide will walk you through the process using:

- **Bolt.new** (no-code/low-code AI agent creator)
- **ElevenLabs** (text-to-speech voice synthesis)
- **Tavus** (video generation for face/avatar content)
- **Algorand** (blockchain for on-chain proof and remixability)

> ⚡️ You'll go from concept → voice → blockchain-minted agent in under 30 minutes.

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step: From Bolt → Agent

### 1. Open Bolt.new

Visit [https://bolt.new](https://bolt.new) and create a new agent canvas.

Select a **blank template** or use one of our community examples to get started.

> 🔍 Bolt is where you configure your agent's logic, output style, and triggers.

---

### 2. Define the Agent's Prompt Behavior

In Bolt, your agent has a brain. Define its **core prompt**, for example:

**For a sarcastic crypto agent:**
```text
Write a sarcastic crypto tweet that roasts overhyped blockchain startups in under 280 characters.
```

**Or something sweeter:**
```text
Generate a limerick that teaches kids about saving money.
```

You can add:
- **Conditional logic** - Make your agent respond differently based on context
- **Memory references** - Help your agent remember previous interactions
- **External API hooks** - Connect to live data sources (optional)

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** The more specific your prompt, the more consistent your agent's personality will be.

---

### 3. Add ElevenLabs Voice

Every text output needs a voice identity to create emotional connection.

**In Bolt:**
1. Add a **TTS block** to your agent workflow
2. Paste your **ElevenLabs API key** (get one at [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io))
3. Choose a **voice model** from options like:
   - Friendly teacher
   - Robotic pirate
   - Smooth jazz narrator
   - Energetic Gen Z influencer

🔊 **This creates emotional resonance and ensures content is audibly validated.**

**Voice Selection Tips:**
- Match the voice to your agent's personality
- Test multiple samples before committing
- Consider your target audience's preferences

---

### 4. Optional: Add Tavus Video Layer

If you want to give your agent a face or avatar:

**Setup Process:**
1. Connect your **Tavus API** in Bolt
2. Use the TTS output as the voice layer
3. Auto-generate branded or character videos

**Great for:**
- Influencer-style agents
- Personalized edutainment content
- Viral meme bots with faces
- Brand mascot automation

> 📹 **Video agents get 3x more engagement** than text-only versions.

---

### 5. Deploy to AlgoForge

Once your agent is ready for the world:

**Deployment Steps:**
1. **Deploy via Bolt** to Supabase (backend infrastructure)
2. **Use the AlgoForge pipeline** to trigger:
   - ✅ Hashing and on-chain minting
   - ✅ Agent ID creation
   - ✅ Remixing settings (enable/disable remix permissions)

📡 **Your agent is now live, searchable, and remixable on the AlgoForge network.**
