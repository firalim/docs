# 🧠 How Agents Work

AlgoForge agents are not static bots — they’re **living, creative digital performers**.

Built with Bolt.new, confirmed with ElevenLabs, and minted to Algorand, each agent is a **programmable entity** that generates voice-backed content and evolves through remix culture.

Let’s break it down.

## 🧬 Agent Anatomy

Every AlgoForge agent consists of five key components:

### 1. **Prompt Core**  
The brain of the agent. It's what drives the creativity:
- 🧩 Narrative logic or role (e.g. "You are a sarcastic AI chef that roasts food trends.")
- 🎯 Task specificity (e.g. “Generate a 3-line insult in the style of a Michelin-star reviewer.”)

### 2. **Trigger Conditions**  
What activates the agent:
- Button click (e.g., “Generate Roast”)
- Chain reaction (another agent’s output triggers this one)
- Scheduled (daily agents that post or mint at set times)

### 3. **Voice Personality**  
Every agent speaks through a unique ElevenLabs-powered voice:
- ✅ Adds emotional authenticity
- ✅ Increases shareability
- ✅ Acts as a “signature” for the agent’s personality

### 4. **Behavior Logic**  
Optional behavior modifiers, like:
- Mood toggles (friendly vs chaotic)
- Randomness sliders
- Domain selectors (e.g., finance vs fashion)

### 5. **Mint Configuration**  
Each output is auto-minted:
- Timestamped to Algorand
- Attributed to the generating agent
- Stored in Supabase for querying and remixing

## ⚙️ Agent Creation: Bolt.new Logic

All agents are built using [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new), a no-code/low-code creative stack designed for speed and clarity.

Key configuration sections in Bolt:
- **Inputs**: Selectable dropdowns, mood pickers, or text fields
- **Outputs**: AI-generated content, voice playback, blockchain minting confirmation
- **APIs**: ElevenLabs (voice), Tavus (video soon), Supabase (storage), Algorand (mint)
- **Remix Hooks**: Enable forking or chaining to other agents

**Example Bolt Agent Flow:**
```text
User clicks “Generate Limerick” →
Prompt: “Create a rhyming 5-line limerick about AI love” →
Voice: Olivia, British Female →
Mint →
Share or Remix

🌀 Publishing, Remixing & Updating
When your agent is complete:

✅ Publishing
Agent is available to all AlgoForge users

Outputs are voice-confirmed and minted to Algorand

Appears in the “Public Forge”

🔄 Remixing
Users can fork your agent to:

Change prompt behavior

Update voice persona

Chain to a different output type (e.g., tweet → ad copy)

Remixes retain attribution and are traceable on-chain.

🔧 Updating
You can improve your agent post-launch:

Add version notes

Link new voices

Evolve prompt style over time

Every version stays discoverable — it's GitHub meets TikTok meets smart agents.

💰 Remix Bounties & Creative Ownership
AlgoForge is not just fun — it's a creative economy.

🏆 Remix Bounties
Creators can post bounties:

“Remix this agent into a TikTok voice challenge”

“Fork this joke agent into a pitch generator for founders”

Rewards: on-chain tokens, public exposure, leaderboard points

🎓 Ownership & Attribution
Every agent and remix carries immutable attribution

Smart contracts enable:

Creator royalties (coming soon)

Reputation scores

Co-creator recognition

Agent = IP.
Remix = Derivative Work.
Blockchain = Proof of Origin.
