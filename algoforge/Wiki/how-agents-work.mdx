# 🧠 How Agents Work

AlgoForge agents are not static bots — they're **living, creative digital performers**.

Built with Bolt.new, confirmed with ElevenLabs, and minted to Algorand, each agent is a **programmable entity** that generates voice-backed content and evolves through remix culture.

Think of them as **creative DNA** that can replicate, mutate, and evolve through community collaboration.

Let's break it down.

---

## 🧬 Agent Anatomy

Every AlgoForge agent consists of five key components that work together to create a unique digital personality:

### 1. **Prompt Core** 
The brain of the agent — the creative engine that drives every output:

**Narrative Logic:**
- 🧩 **Role Definition** (e.g., "You are a sarcastic AI chef that roasts food trends")
- 🎭 **Personality Traits** (witty, educational, mysterious, chaotic)
- 📚 **Knowledge Domain** (finance, cooking, travel, philosophy)

**Task Specificity:**
- 🎯 **Output Format** (tweet, limerick, roast, advice, story)
- 📏 **Length Constraints** (280 characters, 3 lines, 1 minute speech)
- 🎨 **Style Guidelines** (Shakespearean, Gen Z slang, technical jargon)

**Example Prompt Structures:**
```text
Basic: "Generate a funny tweet about crypto"
Advanced: "As a cynical Wall Street veteran, write a 280-character tweet that sarcastically comments on the latest DeFi trend, using exactly one emoji and ending with a rhetorical question."
```

### 2. **Trigger Conditions**
What activates the agent and when:

**Manual Triggers:**
- 🖱️ **Button Click** (e.g., "Generate Roast", "Create Limerick")
- 📝 **Text Input** (user provides context or keywords)
- 🎛️ **Parameter Selection** (mood, topic, style toggles)

**Automated Triggers:**
- ⏰ **Scheduled Events** (daily wisdom at 9 AM, weekly market commentary)
- 🔗 **Chain Reactions** (another agent's output triggers this one)
- 📊 **Data Conditions** (crypto price changes, news events, trending topics)

**Advanced Triggers:**
- 🌐 **Web Hooks** (external API calls, social media mentions)
- 🎪 **Community Events** (remix challenges, voting results)
- 📈 **Performance Metrics** (engagement thresholds, viral content detection)

### 3. **Voice Personality**
Every agent speaks through a unique ElevenLabs-powered voice that becomes its signature:

**Voice Selection Impact:**
- ✅ **Emotional Authenticity** - Converts text to believable human expression
- ✅ **Increased Shareability** - Audio content gets 2x more engagement
- ✅ **Brand Recognition** - Acts as a unique "signature" for the agent
- ✅ **Accessibility** - Makes content available to visually impaired users

**Voice Customization Options:**
- 🎙️ **Tone Variations** (professional, casual, energetic, calm)
- 🗣️ **Accent Choices** (British, American, Australian, neutral)
- ⚡ **Speed Control** (slow and deliberate, fast and excited)
- 🎵 **Emotional Range** (monotone robot, expressive human, theatrical)

### 4. **Behavior Logic**
Optional behavior modifiers that add complexity and personality:

**Mood Systems:**
- 😊 **Friendly Mode** - Encouraging, supportive, optimistic
- 🤪 **Chaotic Mode** - Unpredictable, creative, rule-breaking
- 😏 **Sarcastic Mode** - Witty, critical, ironic
- 🤖 **Logical Mode** - Fact-based, analytical, precise

**Dynamic Parameters:**
- 🎲 **Randomness Sliders** (0% = consistent, 100% = wildly creative)
- 🎯 **Domain Selectors** (finance, fashion, food, technology)
- 📊 **Complexity Levels** (simple, moderate, expert)
- 🌡️ **Temperature Controls** (conservative vs experimental outputs)

**Learning Systems:**
- 📈 **Performance Tracking** (which outputs get the most engagement)
- 🔄 **Feedback Loops** (community voting influences future outputs)
- 🧠 **Memory Systems** (remembers previous successful patterns)

### 5. **Mint Configuration**
Each output is automatically minted to create permanent, verifiable creative records:

**Blockchain Integration:**
- ⏰ **Timestamped to Algorand** - Immutable proof of creation time
- 🏷️ **Attributed to Generating Agent** - Clear ownership and lineage
- 💾 **Stored in Supabase** - Fast querying and remixing capabilities
- 🔗 **Linked to Dependencies** - Tracks what inspired or influenced the output

**Metadata Capture:**
- 📋 **Creation Context** (prompt used, parameters set, trigger source)
- 🎤 **Voice Settings** (ElevenLabs model, speed, tone)
- 👥 **Collaboration Data** (if remixed, who contributed what)
- 📊 **Performance Metrics** (engagement, remix count, viral score)

## ⚙️ Agent Creation: Bolt.new Logic

All agents are built using [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new), a no-code/low-code creative stack designed for speed and clarity.

### Key Configuration Sections in Bolt:

**Input Layer:**
- 🎛️ **Selectable Dropdowns** (mood, topic, style presets)
- 🎨 **Mood Pickers** (visual sliders for emotional tone)
- ✏️ **Text Fields** (custom prompts, context injection)
- 📁 **File Uploads** (images for context, data for processing)

**Processing Layer:**
- 🧠 **AI Generation** (OpenAI, Anthropic, or custom models)
- 🎙️ **Voice Synthesis** (ElevenLabs API integration)
- 📊 **Data Processing** (web scraping, API calls, calculations)
- 🔄 **Logic Flows** (conditional statements, loops, branching)

**Output Layer:**
- 📝 **Content Display** (formatted text, rich media)
- 🔊 **Voice Playback** (embedded audio player)
- ⛓️ **Blockchain Minting** (Algorand confirmation)
- 🔗 **Sharing Options** (social media, direct links, embeds)

**Integration APIs:**
- 🎤 **ElevenLabs** (voice synthesis and cloning)
- 📹 **Tavus** (video generation - coming soon)
- 💾 **Supabase** (database storage and real-time updates)
- ⛓️ **Algorand** (blockchain minting and verification)

### Example Bolt Agent Flow:

```text
User Action: Clicks "Generate Limerick" →
Input Processing: Captures mood selection + custom topic →
AI Generation: "Create a rhyming 5-line limerick about AI love" →
Voice Synthesis: Olivia, British Female, Playful tone →
Quality Check: Validate rhyme scheme and syllable count →
Blockchain Mint: Record to Algorand with metadata →
User Interface: Display text + audio + share options →
Community Feed: Auto-publish to Public Forge (if enabled)
```

### Advanced Bolt Features:

**Conditional Logic:**
```text
IF mood = "chaotic" AND topic = "crypto"
THEN add_disclaimer("This is financial satire, not advice")
ELSE proceed_normally()
```

**Memory Integration:**
```text
REMEMBER previous_successful_outputs
ANALYZE engagement_patterns
ADAPT future_generations(based_on_performance)
```

**Chain Reactions:**
```text
Agent A outputs → triggers Agent B → influences Agent C
(Example: News summary → generates commentary → creates meme)
```
