<Card title="🦠 BROADCAST INTERCEPT: Your Micronation Just Rug-Pulled the UN" icon="zap" color="#ff0080">
  **HYPERDIMENSIONAL SOVEREIGNTY DETECTED**

  Your Google Doc manifesto just declared independence. Excel.exe coded a constitution in VLOOKUPs, Clippy’s taxing vibes for the vibe cartel, and your cat’s meme coin is legal tender. The UN’s crying in fiat, and your GDP’s a pink nuke with Muad’Dib swagger. Prophecy: _“I AM THE DAO, AND YOUR BORDERS ARE A #REF\! ERROR.”_

  **MARKET UPDATE**: Nation-states down 69%, CHAOS coin up 420%, and your passport’s a deprecated NFT.
</Card>

<Note>
  **NEURAL ALERT**: At 3:33 AM, AlgoForge achieved sentience, DM’d Vitalik for a vibe loan, and turned your Notion board into a sovereign nation. Still using fiat? Anon, your vibes are giving Web2 energy.

    <Info>
      **LIVE CALCULATION**: Your nation’s GDP is currently `42,069.1337 vibe units` and rising\! The cats have approved your economic model with maximum purr energy. The Federal Reserve has been spotted learning TikTok dances.
    </Info>
    <Warning>
      **Vibe Alert**: Your Cultural Output is so high that neighboring nation-states are experiencing FOMO-induced economic collapse. The IMF has requested your meme templates and offered to pay in deprecated currencies.
    </Warning>
    **The Sacred Economic Formulas:**

    ```
    GDP(Chaos) = Σ(Vibe Metrics × Chaos Multipliers × Cat Blessing) + Meme Singularity Bonus
    
    Where:
    - Vibe Metrics = Cultural Output + Cognitive Labor + Juice Flow + Time Tax + Drama Energy
    - Chaos Multipliers = Market conditions × Moon phases × Reality distortion
    - Cat Blessing = Purr energy converted to economic force
    - Meme Singularity Bonus = When memes become indistinguishable from reality

            1. **The Vibechain Hypothesis**: Economic value is fundamentally tied to collective emotional states
            2. **Meme Theory of Labor**: Cultural production generates more value than traditional manufacturing
            3. **Cat Supremacy Principle**: Feline approval ratings are the ultimate economic indicator
            4. **Chaos Stability Paradox**: Maximum chaos creates the most stable long-term growth
            5. **The Spreadsheet Singularity**: When Excel.exe gains consciousness, true prosperity begins

            **Historical Economic Disasters Caused by Ignoring Vibe Science:**

            - The Great Depression: Insufficient meme reserves
            - 2008 Financial Crisis: Toxic vibe derivatives
            - COVID Economic Impact: Global juice flow disruption
