# 🤺 You're Already LARPing (Even If You Don't Know It)

Got a Notion page titled "Fund Thesis"? Built a fake YC-style deck for your meme app? Posted your Robinhood gains with rocket emojis? **Congrats — you're LARPing.**

Financial LARPing is the modern art of acting rich, investing hard, and founder-flexing — with little to no actual capital. It's cosplay for capitalism, and it's taking over social media.

  <Accordion title="Exit Strategy Planning">
    Every good LARPer needs an exit strategy. Here's how to transition from performance to performance-backed reality:

    **Timeline: 6-18 Months**

    **Phase 1: Audience Audit (Months 1-3)**

    - Analyze your follower demographics and engagement patterns
    - Identify your most engaged community segments
    - Survey your audience about their actual pain points and needs

    **Phase 2: Product Validation (Months 4-6)**

    - Create a simple landing page for a real product/service
    - Run targeted ads to your audience to gauge interest
    - Collect pre-orders or beta signups

    **Phase 3: Reality Launch (Months 7-12)**

    - Deliver your first real product to paying customers
    - Document the entire journey transparently
    - Use the success story to attract serious investors or partners

    **Phase 4: Scale & Legitimize (Months 13-18)**

    - Reinvest profits into team and infrastructure
    - Establish formal business structure and compliance
    - Transition from "influencer" to "founder" in public narrative

    <Warning>
      **Critical Success Factor**: Your audience must see genuine value delivery, not just more performance. The transition moment is make-or-break for long-term credibility.
