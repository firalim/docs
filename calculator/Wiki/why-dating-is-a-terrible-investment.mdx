</CardGroup>

**Dating apps promise love. You get ghosted, gaslit, and Venmo-charged for brunch.**

In VC terms: **Dating is a pre-seed round with zero product-market fit, no due diligence, and catastrophic burn rate.**

So why do we keep investing? 🤔

<Tip>
  Like any failed startup, dating often lacks a clear value proposition and sustainable business model. Unlike startups, you can't pivot to B2B when the consumer market doesn't work out.
</Tip>

## 📉 What Is IRR (and Why It Doesn't Work for Dating)?

**IRR (Internal Rate of Return)** is used to measure the profitability of investments based on expected cash flows.

<Frame>
  ```
  NPV = Σ (Cash Flow_t / (1 + IRR)^t) = 0
  ```
</Frame>

But in dating, this formula breaks down faster than your 4th Hinge date in a row:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Traditional Finance ❌">
    - Predictable cash flows
    - Measurable ROI
    - Clear exit strategy
    - Risk assessment models
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Dating Finance 💔">
    - Cash flows = "good vibes"
    - Initial investment = emotions \+ \$37 cocktails
    - Exit strategy = ????
    - Risk = existential dread
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## 💘 Emotional ROI: The Real Metric That Hurts

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="💸 Investment Inputs" icon="arrow-down" color="#7c3aed">
    - **127 hours** spent texting
    - **43 compliments** given
    - **6.5 hours** Spotify playlist curation
    - **\$347** in Uber rides to "cute" places
  </Card>
  <Card title="📉 Actual Returns" icon="arrow-up" color="#dc2626">
    - **∞** two-second voice note replies
    - **12** emotional whiplash incidents
    - **8** "bad at texting" excuses
    - **0%** closure received
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  **Emotional ROI Result: -87.3%**

  You're emotionally bankrupt, but at least you learned about yourself\! 🙃
