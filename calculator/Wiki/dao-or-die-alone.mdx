# 💘 DAO or DIE ALONE

**Decentralized relationships. Smart contract consent. Proof-of-Feelings.**

Because love is too important to leave to central authorities.

**TL;DR for the Degen Hearts**: You're not _needy_ — you're proposing a governance model. You're not _indecisive_ — you're requesting a quorum. You're not _toxic_ — you're proposing a **soft fork** to the relationship. Welcome to DAO-based dating\! 🚀

## 🏛️ What Is a Love DAO?

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization that governs your romantic relationship via smart contracts, community consensus, and token-weighted decision-making.

## Traditional Love vs Love DAO

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Traditional Love (Web2)">
    **Single Point of Failure** ❌\
    One person can ruin everything. No redundancy. Very Web2.

    **Zero Transparency** ❌\
    "What are you thinking?" remains the greatest unsolved mystery.

    **Centralized Decisions** ❌\
    Whoever cries loudest wins. Democracy? Never heard of her.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Love DAO (Web3)">
    **Multi-Sig Emotions** ✅\
    All major feelings require 2/2 consensus. No more unilateral crying.

    **Transparent Proposals** ✅\
    Every relationship update goes through the proposal system. With receipts.

    **Automated Conflict Resolution** ✅\
    Smart contracts handle the circular arguments. Peace at last.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  **Breaking**: Traditional relationships are having a liquidity crisis. Love DAO offers sustainable tokenomics for long-term emotional growth. 📈

## 💎 Smart Contract Modules

### Attention Validator Protocol

Verifies who's _actually_ listening during those 3AM relationship talks.

**How it works:**

- Random attention checks during conversations ✅
- "What did I just say?" validation prompts 🤖
- Eye contact mining rewards 👀
- Phone-checking penalties with automatic \$LOVE slashing 📱💀

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Attention Validator
function validateAttention(partner, conversationHash) {
    if (partner.phoneChecks > MAX_DISTRACTIONS) {
        slashLoveTokens(partner, DISTRACTION_PENALTY);
        emit AttentionSlashEvent(partner, "Excessive phone usage during feels");
    }
    return partner.attentionScore;
}
```


```solidity Smart Contract
contract AttentionProtocol {
    mapping(address => uint256) public attentionScores;
    uint256 constant PHONE_CHECK_PENALTY = 10;
    
    modifier payingAttention() {
        require(attentionScores[msg.sender] > 50, "Please put phone down");
        _;
    }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Anti-Manipulation Protocol

If a partner tries to manipulate you, gas fees skyrocket. It's literally not worth the gas. ⛽💸

**🚨 Manipulation Tax Schedule:**

- "You're being too sensitive" → **0.1 ETH fee**
- "I never said that" (with on-chain proof) → **0.5 ETH fee**
- "You're crazy" → **Therapy staking required**
- "That's not what I meant" (\>3x/day) → **Gas fees double**

<CodeGroup>

```solidity Manipulation Protection
modifier noGaslighting(string memory statement) {
    require(!isGaslighting(statement), "Manipulation detected: Pay gas fee");
    if (detectManipulation(msg.sender)) {
        chargeFee(msg.sender, GASLIGHT_PENALTY);
    }
    _;
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## 🚨 Emergency Protocols

<AccordionGroup>

    1. **Grace Period**: 30-day cooling off with staked \$TRUST tokens
    2. **Mediation**: Community-elected arbitrators review the case
    3. **Asset Distribution**: Smart contract handles shared NFTs and tokens
    4. **Reputation Update**: Both parties' scores adjusted based on conduct
    5. **Network Effects**: Mutual friends get notification of availability status

    **Emergency Exit**: Immediate breakup possible with 90% \$TRUST token burn penalty.

  <Accordion title="Cheating Detection">
    Advanced on-chain analytics detect suspicious behavioral patterns:

    - Unusual location data correlations 📍

    - Third-party validation from mutual friend oracles 👥

    **Penalty**: Complete stake slashing \+ permanent reputation damage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mental Health Support">
    Because even decentralized love needs centralized therapy:

    - Automatic depression detection via text sentiment analysis 😔
    - Crisis intervention smart contracts 🆘

    - Wellness check-ins with accountability partners 💚
  </Accordion>

## 🤔 Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if we disagree on everything?">
    That's what the governance tokens are for\! Major disagreements require community mediation through your trusted friend network. If you can't reach consensus, the relationship may need a governance model upgrade (therapy) or a hard fork (break up).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I be in multiple Love DAOs?">
    Absolutely\! We support polyamorous governance structures with sophisticated resource allocation algorithms. Your emotional bandwidth is tracked on-chain to prevent overcommitment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What about privacy?">
    All emotional data is encrypted and stored on IPFS. Only governance votes and major relationship milestones are recorded on-chain. Your 3AM vulnerability sessions remain private.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is this legally binding?">
    Not yet, but we're working on it\! Currently, Love DAOs are social contracts with economic incentives. Legal integration coming in Phase 4.
