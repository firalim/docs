<Card title="🚨 Executive Summary">
  Dating apps promise love. You get ghosted, gaslit, and Venmo-charged for brunch.

  In VC terms: Dating is a **pre-seed round with zero product-market fit**, no due diligence, and catastrophic burn rate.

  <Info>
    Like any failed startup, dating often lacks a clear value proposition and sustainable business model. Unlike startups, you can't pivot to B2B when the consumer market doesn't work out.

  [**Pro Tip from fc.firuz-alimov.com**](https://fc.firuz-alimov.com): Before optimizing your dating ROI, ensure your financial portfolio can handle the emotional volatility. Check out our investment strategies that actually work.
</Tip>

## 📉 IRR (Internal Rate of Ruin?)

**IRR** measures financial returns over time. It assumes:

- Predictable cash flows
- Rational actors
- A future

But in dating:

- You get breadcrumbed
- Ghosted mid-vacation
- Or left with the dog and the Spotify account

So we introduce...

## 🧠 Emotional ROI (eROI)

<Info>
  **eROI = Emotional Return on Investment** — the vibes, self-worth, and stories gained (or lost) from a relationship.
</Info>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="IRR Example" icon="trending-up">
