  **Reality Check**: Your apartment might be more profitable as a TikTok set than a rental property. Let's prove it with math\! 🧮

<Info>
  **How Clout Rate Works**:

  - Clout Rate = (Monthly Revenue - Monthly Investment) / Monthly Investment × 100
  - Compare this to real estate cap rates (4-12% annually)
  - Remember: Higher returns come with higher risk, but the potential is massive\! 📈
