# üî• How to Build a Family Office for Your Meme Coin Empire

**Because generational wealth starts with a Discord and ends with a Cayman shell corp.**

---

## üê∂ It Started with a Dog Token‚Ä¶

You bought \$500 of Shiba Inu in 2021. You held. You tweeted. You prayed to the Doge gods.

Now? You're a **paper billionaire** with a liquidity problem, a tax nightmare, and three cousins sliding into your DMs asking to be your "Chief Vibes Officer."

Time to do the only rational thing left:

<Card title="üëâ Build a Family Office" icon="building-columns">
  Because _what's the point of mooning if your grandkids can't rug pull responsibly?_

  Your meme coin fortune needs structure, strategy, and just enough legitimacy to pass generational wealth transfer laws (while maintaining maximum chaos).

<Warning>
  **Reality Check**: This guide assumes you've already survived the emotional trauma of watching your portfolio swing \$10M in a single Elon tweet. If not, please consult our previous guide: "Coping with Crypto PTSD Through Excel Therapy."

  Your grandchildren deserve more than just a Lambo story and a screenshot of a wallet balance.
