### Step 1: The Remix Process

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="üéöÔ∏è Slider Manipulation Mastery" icon="sliders-horizontal">
    **The Golden Rules:**

    1. **If it looks too conservative, multiply by 10**
    2. **If it looks too aggressive, add a footnote with smaller font**
    3. **If it doesn't make sense, call it "proprietary methodology"**
    4. **If someone questions it, blame market conditions**

    **Pro Techniques:**

    - Set loan interest to "whatever makes my deal look good"
    - Use terms like "Until TikTok shuts down" or "When I get verified"
    - Express time horizons in "internet years" (1 month = 1 traditional year)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="üìù Notes Section Wizardry" icon="edit">
    Transform boring assumptions into compelling narratives:

    **Before:** "5% vacancy rate assumed"

    **After:** "Market research indicates 95% occupancy sustainability based on our proprietary community engagement algorithms and the human need for belonging in an increasingly digital world."

    **Advanced Version:** "Conservative 95% occupancy projections supported by focus group data from three satisfied customers (my mom, my therapist, and a stranger who liked my Instagram story)."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="üé® Export Artistry" icon="download">
    **Presentation Formats Ranked by Credibility:**

    1. **Linen paper PDF** (99% credibility boost)
    2. **Slideshow with stock photos of handshakes** (87% credibility)
    3. **Excel file with locked cells** (134% credibility - off the charts)
    4. **Printed and bound with spiral binding** (Immediate investor interest)
    5. **Laminated and presented in manila folder** (Venture capital ready)

        **What it really is:** Net Operating Income √∑ Annual Debt Service

        **Why banks care:** They want to know if your building can pay its own bills

        **What you're learning:** The difference between revenue ("I sold $1M in t-shirts!") and cash flow ("But it cost me $1.2M to make them...")

        **The satirical insight:** Most "disruptive" businesses have DSCR ratios that would make accountants cry
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="üé¢ Leverage: The Double-Edged Sword of Dreams" icon="trending-up">
        **The Math:** Other People's Money √ó Your Ideas = Amplified Everything

        **When it works:** 10% return becomes 50% return on your investment

        **When it doesn't:** You owe more money than exists in your zip code

        **The satirical truth:** Every viral business success story conveniently omits the leverage ratios
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="üìà Cap Rates: The Reality Check Formula" icon="calculator">
        **Formula:** Net Operating Income √∑ Property Value = Cap Rate

        **Translation:** "Is this thing actually worth what I'm paying for it?"

        **Market wisdom:** Lower cap rate = higher price (and higher risk that you're overpaying)

        **Satirical application:** Your abandoned water park better generate some serious NOI to justify that \$15M valuation

        **The Performance:** Professional formatting \+ confident presentation = temporary suspension of disbelief

        **The Psychology:** People want to believe in the next big thing (even when it's obviously satire)

        **The Learning:** Understanding presentation vs. substance in real investment opportunities

        **The Application:** Spotting actual financial theater in the wild (spoiler: it's everywhere)
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="üìä The Power of Assumptions" icon="crystal-ball">
        **The Secret:** Every financial model is just a fancy way of organizing assumptions

        **The Danger:** Garbage assumptions in = garbage conclusions out (but with impressive charts)

        **The Skill:** Learning to identify and question the assumptions behind any pitch

        **The Wisdom:** The most important numbers are usually in the footnotes
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="üí° Innovation vs. Delusion Recognition Training" icon="lightbulb">
        **Pattern Recognition:**

        - Real innovation: Solves actual problems people have
        - Financial theater: Solves problems people didn't know they had (and probably don't)

        **Red Flag Detection:**

        - Multiple buzzwords per sentence
        - Revenue models involving "network effects" and "virality"
        - Any business plan that requires changing human behavior

        **The Paradox:** Some of today's biggest successes started as obvious jokes
