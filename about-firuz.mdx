## Innovation Methodology

### "Vibe Coding on Drugs"

<Note>

2. **Emotional Intelligence**: Technology that understands and responds to human emotion
3. **Iterative Perfection**: Continuous improvement through rapid experimentation
4. **Cultural Relevance**: Solutions that resonate with diverse user contexts

### Design Philosophy

Technology is meaningless unless it solves **human pain points** in culturally relevant ways. I embed **lived experience, emotional value, and behavioral design** into every interface I touch.

    2. **Behavioral Mapping**: Understanding user psychology and decision-making patterns
    3. **Emotional Journey**: Designing for emotional states and transitions

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Systems Thinking Approach">
    1. **Ecosystem Mapping**: Understanding interconnected relationships
