## üî¨ Research Methodology & Learnings

### Our Approach

<Card title="Mixed Methods Research" icon="microscope">
  **Quantitative Data:**

  - 10,247 survey responses
  - 15,000\+ in-app behavioral data points
  - A/B tests across 47 feature variations

  **Qualitative Insights:**

  - 50\+ user interviews
  - Discord community feedback
  - Social media sentiment analysis

</Card>

### Key Learnings for Product Teams

<Tip>
  **Design Principle #1**: Meet users in their emotional state, not where you think they should be.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Design Principle #2**: Humor disarms financial anxiety‚Äîbut it must be authentic, not patronizing.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Design Principle #3**: Gamification works when it mirrors real emotional stakes, not just points.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

  - Don't infantilize users with "cute" financial advice
  - Avoid shame-based motivation (even subtle guilt)
  - Don't over-gamify to the point of losing utility
  - Never ignore the genuine stress of financial insecurity
</Warning>
