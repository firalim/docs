<Card title="Cultural Shift Alert" icon="trending-up">
  Gen Z has transformed financial shame into a powerful learning tool. Meet the roast culture that's changing how we talk about money.

This isn't just oversharing ‚Äî it's **a movement**.

## üî• Welcome to Financial Self-Drag Culture

Gen Z and late Millennials are turning **financial failure into content**.\

    - _Hidden struggles, private failures_
