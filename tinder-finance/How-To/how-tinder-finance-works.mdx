#### 🤑 Budget Battle Royale – How It Works

**Setup:**  
Start each round with a randomized monthly income between **$2,500 and $5,000**. The goal? Survive the month without going broke.

**Gameplay Loop:**

1. **Drag & Drop Funds** into three key budget zones:
   - 🏠 Essentials (e.g., rent, groceries, bills)
   - 🎉 Fun (e.g., parties, concerts, dining out)
   - 💰 Savings/Investing (e.g., emergency fund, crypto stash)

2. **Dodge Random Financial Traps** that pop up mid-game:
   - Car repair: –$400  
   - Forgotten subscription: –$50  
   - Sudden vet bill: –$250

3. **Make Snap Decisions:**
   - Friend's Vegas trip — *Join (–$600)* or *Skip?*
   - Crypto bro pitches NFT — *Invest (–$200)* or *Pass?*
   - Work bonus arrives — *Spend or Save?*

**Outcomes:**
- ✅ *“You survived with $50 left! 🏆”*  
- ❌ *“Bankrupt by Day 20 😵”*

**XP Rewards:**
- 200 XP for surviving the month  
- 50 XP for each trap successfully dodged  
- 100 XP for winning in multiplayer mode  

*Financial survival has never been this fun.*

- "Subscribed to 9 streaming services and watches none"

**AI Roast Output:**  
> *“You dropped $300 on sneakers? Your savings just ran away barefoot. 🫠”*

**Feature Highlights:**
