### What Every Proposal Includes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Strategic Architecture">
    Every proposal begins with a custom-engineered solution blueprint. We map out the technical backbone of your transformation — including data flows, modular architecture, integration patterns, and user journeys.

    <br />

    <br />

    Whether it's an AI decision engine, a cross-platform app, or a blockchain-based verification layer, the design aligns with your goals, constraints, and future scale. Built with Six Sigma logic and human-centered design principles.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Timelines & Milestones">
    Your proposal includes a week-by-week breakdown of deliverables — from kickoff to deployment. We provide clear sprints, testing cycles, approval gates, and performance checkpoints.

    <br />

    <br />

    Each milestone includes success criteria, responsible parties, and linked KPIs to ensure we’re shipping measurable value at every phase.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="ROI Projections">
    No project should be a leap of faith. We model your ROI using baseline data, efficiency gains, and industry benchmarks.

    <br />

    <br />

    Expect forecasted savings, new revenue potential, and impact across key performance indicators — from CAC and conversion rates to ops costs and time-to-market. Delivered as a transparent Excel model or integrated dashboard.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tech Stack & Resources">
    We outline the exact tools, frameworks, cloud services, and human expertise required to deliver the solution.

    <br />

    <br />

    You'll get a breakdown of all required technologies (e.g., React, Supabase, LangChain, Zapier), plus resource needs like developers, analysts, or AI trainers — and estimated cost ranges across build, run, and optimize phases.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Collaboration Roadmap">
    Seamless integration with your internal team is a priority. Our proposals define exactly how we’ll co-build with you — from Slack channels and Git access to shared Notion workspaces and live review calls.

    <br />

    <br />

    You'll know who’s doing what, when, and how communication flows. Includes stakeholder sync plans, escalation paths, and agile ceremony suggestions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Risk Mitigation">
    We proactively identify technical, operational, and strategic risks — and offer mitigation plans for each.

    <br />

    <br />

    From fallback architectures and data privacy protocols to team continuity and budget overruns, you’ll have clear backup strategies to ensure project resilience. Every proposal includes a risk register and mitigation matrix.
  </Accordion>
